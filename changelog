11.05.12
sL Polynom re-evaluated form Konnov (2008) (lower than Ardey)
removed the slope limiters from the Fluxes library

03.07.12
Version 11:
separate transport equations fof tauHI and tauLO

17.08.12
Version 14:
add the turbulent transport of enthalpy to eEqn and euEqn:
	- fvc::laplacian(turbulence->alphaEff(), h) // no longer neglected !
has to be explicit, as h is not the variable solved for, but rhoE
